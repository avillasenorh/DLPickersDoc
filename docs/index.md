# Documentation for IFIC-ICM project on comparision of Deep Learning phase pickers

This site contains documentation on the IFIC-ICM project to evaluate existing 
phase pickers based on Deep Learning.

The phase pickers being considered are:

- GPD
- EQTransformer
- PhaseNet

These pickers are being tested using 3 datasets:

- Seismicity prior to the 2011 El Hierro eruption
- Seismic crisis induced by gas injection at the CASTOR undergroung gas storage
- Seismicity in the Arzacq-Mauleon basin (SW France) recorded by the large-N
  Maupasacq experiment

Data and source code in CSIC [GitLab](https://git.csic.es/seismicai) (private).
